              <p>  He has an interesting story about what he did during world war two. He was with the 101st airbourne during word war 2. When he was in training he got the nickname jumping Joe, due to he would take people training jump. When he finished training, he went on a 2 jumps into German controlled France and succeded in helping the French and leaving alive. The third jumped was during D-Day in which, he destroyed some objective he was tasked with but was captured. He was questioned and his dog tags thrown away. He was then sent to a P.O.W camp and tried mutiple times to escape. One of them, was that he boarded a train to Berlin on accident, and was tortured by the Gestapo, but sent to the camp again. The second attempt, was succesful and was able to link up with the red army. And the crazy thing was that he fought alongside them for a while, just to see how this front was. He then went to the American essamby in Moscow and sent home.
